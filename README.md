# ðŸ“Š Criteo AXSI Portfolio Project

This project simulates a real-world scenario for Criteo's **Analytics Solutions & Innovation (AXSI)** team. It demonstrates key skills in data analysis, solution prototyping, and upper-funnel marketing measurement using Python, SQL logic, and Streamlit.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

To build a simulated analytics prototype that helps measure the impact of upper-funnel marketing campaigns by analyzing exposure, engagement, and conversion behavior.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Plotly)** â€“ Data simulation, transformation, and visualization
- **Streamlit** â€“ Interactive dashboard for stakeholder insights
- **Git/GitHub** â€“ Version control
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ Data simulation and EDA
- *(Simulated environment: no Hadoop or Vertica required)*

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard Features

**â–¶ [Live demo here](https://www.charlotteevason.com/)**

The Streamlit dashboard includes:

### 1. Overview Tab
- KPI Cards: CTR, Dwell Time, Conversion Rate
- Histogram: Engagement Score Distribution

### 2. Exposure Analysis
- Conversion Rate by Exposure Frequency

### 3. Engagement Analysis
- Conversion Rate by Engagement Score (note: data is random, explained in insights)

## ðŸ§  Business Insights Summary

- While exposure frequency showed a clear link to conversion uplift, engagement metrics appeared flat across groups. This highlights the need for behavior-driven sampling or real user data for deeper analysis.
- A detailed breakdown is available in the included [Criteo_AXSI_Insights.pdf](./Criteo_AXSI_Insights.pdf).

## âœ… Key Skills Demonstrated

- Translating business needs into prototype solutions
- Building and visualizing KPIs for marketing performance
- Communicating data limitations and insights clearly
- Using Python and Streamlit to simulate and present business logic
